        Cats have never been bred for economic purposes; their matings are
        extremely difficult to control unless the animals are completely
        confined. There has been relatively little scientific breeding of cats,
        and the details of breed inheritance in these animals are not well
        known. Cats are genetically far less plastic than dogs and therefore
        have not offered the same opportunities to breeders. The size
        differences between breeds in the domestic dog have no parallel in the
        domestic cat, nor has anything even remotely approaching the wide range
        of head shapes and body proportions in different breeds of dogs ever
        appeared among the cats. In cats the physical differences between one
        breed and another are largely differences in colour and texture of the
        coat.

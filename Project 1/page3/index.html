          The average weight of the household cat varies from 2.7 to 4.5 kg (6
          to 10 pounds), although, among nonpedigreed cats, weights up to 12.7
          kg (28 pounds) are not uncommon. Average lengths are 71.1 cm (28
          inches) for males and 50.8 cm (20 inches) for females. In keeping with
          a carnivorous habit, the cat has a simple gut; the small intestine is
          only about three times the length of the body.

          The skin of the cat, composed of dermis and epidermis, regenerates and
          fights off infection quickly. Tiny erector muscles, attached to hair
          follicles, enable the cat to bristle all over. Thus, although the cat
          is a relatively small animal, it can frighten enemies by arching its
          back, bristling, and hissing.

          Cats are among the most highly specialized of the flesh-eating
          mammals. Their brains are large and well developed. Cats are
          digitigrade; that is, they walk on their toes. Unlike the dog and
          horse, the cat walks or runs by moving first the front and back legs
          on one side, then the front and back legs on the other side; only the
          camel and the giraffe move in a similar way. The catâ€™s body has great
          elasticity. Because the vertebrae of the spinal column are held
          together by muscles rather than by ligaments, as in humans, the cat
          can elongate or contract its back, curve it upward, or oscillate it
          along the vertebral line. The construction of the shoulder joints
          permits the cat to turn its foreleg in almost any direction. Cats are
          powerfully built animals and are so well coordinated that they almost
          invariably land on their feet if they fall or are dropped.

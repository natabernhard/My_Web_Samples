      <p>
        About 40,000,000 (forty million) years ago, there was a time when there
        were no cats in the world. Absolutely none. There were many other
        animals. One group of animals was called "Miacids," and it gradually
        evolved into the first cat. But this took millions of years. It was like
        the slow movement of transformers. This is how nature works, and
        although even today many people disagree with this, the majority still
        believe it. The way animals gradually change over millions of years is
        an important subject. It's called "evolution." Animals "evolve." Here's
        what happens. Sometimes, when animals are born, they are different from
        their parents. This can be a mistake of nature. But if this newborn can
        survive more easily because it's different, it will also be better at
        passing on this difference to its offspring, and so there will be more
        animals of this type. And then, there will only be animals of this type.
        This process takes a very long time. It turned out that the first animal
        in the world that truly looked like a cat and walked like a cat lived
        around 10,000,000 (ten million) years ago. It was called the
        pseudoelurus.

        This cat lived in Europe, Asia, and North America. It had a strange
        name, but people who knew cats and animals very well liked to give names
        to animals using an old language called Latin. This made them sound more
        important. These animals no longer exist in the world because they
        evolved into other animals. Then, very gradually, a cat named Martelli
        Cat appeared in the world. He lived in Europe about two and a half
        million years ago. Around the same time, saber-toothed tigers lived in
        the world. Saber-toothed tigers are not real tigers. This big cat is no
        longer around. It completely disappeared about 10,000 years ago. The
        saber-toothed tiger could not survive. Cat experts believe that the
        first lions, leopards, cheetahs, and jaguars in the world lived around
        the same time as Martelli Cat (2.5 million years ago). The tiger
        appeared about one and a half million years ago. The dates are not
        certain. Martelli Cat evolved into many modern small wild cats. One of
        these small wild cats, called the African wildcat, had the courage to
        live near humans because people were farmers, and the cat enjoyed eating
        the mice that fed on the grain grown by the farmers. Gradually, the
        wildcat and humans became friends because both made each other's lives a
        little better. The cat killed rats, which helped the farmer, and the
        cat's reward was food. It was a good deal. This first happened about
        9,500 years ago in a place on the eastern side of the Mediterranean Sea.
        The result of this friendship was the world's first domesticated cats.
        We know this happened because a burial site was found with a human and
        an African wildcat at his feet. The grave was about 9,500 years old.

        Ancient Egyptians were people who truly domesticated many cats. The
        domestic cat was very useful for eliminating rats and snakes. About 3000
        years ago, the domestic cat became a part of the Egyptians' lives. They
        became so integral to their lives that they worshiped the cat, elevating
        it to the status of a god. But in worshiping the cat, they also
        committed bad deeds, sacrificing cats to please their feline deity.
        Today, Egyptians still keep cats, and they are known as Egyptian Maus.
        The domestic cat was a helpful animal companion 3000 years ago. This led
        to cats traveling with people who embarked on journeys to distant places
        to sell goods. The domestic cat spread to other parts of the world. The
        first domestic cats appeared in India about 1500 years ago and in Russia
        about 1300 years ago. Romans brought domestic cats to Britain when they
        invaded the island about 1900 years ago. North America was one of the
        last places where domestic cats could be seen. When people from Europe
        arrived on ships to settle in America 300-400 years ago, they brought
        ship cats with them. Cats were useful mousers both on ships and on land.
        Some of the early cats that came to people from Europe gradually became
        the first Maine Coon and American Shorthair cats. Both of these cats are
        popular breeds today. Between their arrival on the East Coast of America
        and today, they served as barn cats, catching rats and mice. Both wild
        and domestic cats, being talented at survival and mysterious in their
        nocturnal behaviors, have simultaneously fascinated and instilled fear.
        The founder of the Muslim faith, Prophet Muhammad, who lived about 1400
        years ago, lived with a cat named Muadz in Damascus. Muhammad respected
        and loved cats, and for this reason, cats are allowed in mosques today.
        Around the same time, in Peru and Chile, people worshipped the god of
        the puma. The puma is a large wild cat that still inhabits some parts of
        Chile in South America. In Buddhist temples, cats are kept as mouse
        hunters. The Christian religion had both positive and negative impacts
        on cats. Thousands of years ago, during the time of Jesus, wild cats
        lived in Israel, but there is no mention of cats in the Bible. In 1232
        (780 years ago as of 2012), the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church
        declared that people who did not believe but instead worshipped the
        devil, and he said the devil was a black cat. Now it sounds absurd, but
        back then, it was taken very seriously. Over the next 460 years, the
        poor cat was persecuted by the Christian Church. Cats were wrongly
        accused of the bubonic plague in 1347â€“1348. Cats were considered
        companions to witches, and witches were burned at the stakes. In Europe,
        where people were Catholics, if you had a cat, you were tortured and
        killed. Cats were truly seen as a devil, and as a result, they were
        mistreated. Even as recently as 1692, in Salem, Americans stood trial as
        witches. These dark times for cats are now in the past, and cats are
        generally loved today. However, there are still many people today who
        fear and dislike cats. Around the mid-1800s (about 160 years ago),
        people who truly loved cats decided to create a club to show off their
        cats to each other and others. They believed they could enhance the
        appearance of their cats by ensuring that specific cats mated with
        others they liked and selected. This led to the creation of purebred cat
        breeds. These individuals are part of what is known as the "Cat Fancy."

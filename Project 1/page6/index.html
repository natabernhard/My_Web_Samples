      <ul>
        <li>A cat sees about 6 times better than a human at night.</li>
        <li>
          When a cat drinks, its tongue – which has tiny barbs on it – scoops
          the liquid up backwards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Healthy adult cats are in deep sleep 15 percent of their lives. They
          are in light sleep 50 percent of the time. That leaves just 35 percent
          awake time, or roughly 6-8 hours a day.
        </li>
        <li>
          A cat’s jaw can only move back to front, not side to side. This makes
          sense because they are predators (meat-eaters), rather than grazers
          (plant-eaters).
        </li>
        <li>
          A female kitten can become pregnant as young as 4 months of age.
        </li>
        <li>Lots of cats will run like crazy after using the litter pan.</li>
        <li>
          Cats Have the Same Number of Brain Cells in Their Cerebral Cortex as
          Brown Bears.
        </li>
        <li>Only 20% of Orange Cats Are Female.</li>

        The cat has a subtle repertoire of facial expressions, vocal sounds, and
        tail and body postures that express its emotional state and intentions.
        These various signals serve to increase, decrease, or maintain social
        distance. One distinctive social behaviour involves rubbing the side of
        the head, lips, chin, or tail against the owner and against furniture.
        These regions of the cat’s body contain scent glands that seem to play a
        role in establishing a familiar odour in the cat’s environment.

        The tongue of all cats, which has a patch of sharp, backward-directed
        spines called filiform papillae near the tip, has the appearance and
        feel of a coarse file; the spines help the cat to groom itself. The
        disposition to cleanliness is well established in cats, and they groom
        themselves at length, especially after meals. While lions and other big
        cats roar, domestic cats and other Felis species purr. Purring has been
        described as a low, continuous, rattling hum and often is interpreted as
        an expression of pleasure or contentment. Purring also occurs in cats
        that are injured and in pain, however, so that this vocalization can be
        seen as the cat’s “mantra”—that is, as a relaxing, self-comforting sound
        and a friendly mood-conveying signal.

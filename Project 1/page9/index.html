      Q1: Why does my cat knead me with their paws? <br />
      A1: Kneading, or making biscuits with their paws, is a behavior commonly
      associated with contentment and relaxation in cats. It often stems from
      kittenhood when they kneaded their mother's belly to stimulate milk flow.
      <br />
      <br />
      Q2: Why does my cat meow excessively? <br />
      A2: Excessive meowing in cats can indicate various things such as hunger,
      stress, illness, or seeking attention. Understanding the context and any
      accompanying behaviors can help determine the underlying cause.

      Q3: How can I stop my cat from scratching furniture? <br />
      A3: Scratching is a natural behavior in cats used to mark territory and
      maintain their claws. Providing appropriate scratching posts, regular nail
      trimming, and using deterrents on furniture can help redirect this
      behavior.
      <br />
      <br />
      Q4: Why does my cat stare at me? <br />
      A4: Cats may stare at their owners as a form of communication or to gauge
      their reactions. It can also be a sign of affection or curiosity.

      Q5: What does it mean when my cat flicks their tail? <br />
      A5: Tail flicking in cats can convey various emotions and intentions. A
      slowly twitching tail may indicate contentment, while rapid flicking can
      signal agitation or annoyance. Understanding other body language cues can
      provide context for interpreting tail movements.
